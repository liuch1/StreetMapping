StreetMapping is a program that plots a map of roads and intersections from data given, gives shortest distance to travel
between two points using Dijkstra, and generate a minimum weight spanning tree for the entire map.

Make sure all programs and files are in the same directory*
To run it please go through the following in terminal:
	java --version
	(Select path to where the file location of StreetMapping.java is using cd *name*)
	javac *.java 
	java Main *nameoffile.txt*
	These are the following instructions that can added after the line above:
	-show (uses GUI to make map)
	-directions startingIntersection endingIntersection (provides shortest distance traveled in miles)
	-meridianmap (highlights roads traveled)
	Combine however you want, except -directions and -meridianmap
